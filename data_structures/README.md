# Data Structure

Here are some of the most commonly used data structures, along with brief explainations and examples of their typical usage:

## Arrays/Lists

### Characteristics

-   Fixed-size or dynamic-size collection of elements.
-   Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.

### Usage

-   Access elements by index in constant time.
-   Commonly used for problems involving sequence processing, searching, and sorting.

## Strings

### Characteristics

-   Sequence of characters.
-   Immutable in many programming languages, including Python.

### Usage

-   Problems involving text processing, pattern matching, and manipulation.

## Linked List

### Characteristics

-   A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node.
-   Dynamic size and easy insertion/deletion of elements.

### Usage

-   Problems where dynamic memory allocation is needed or where operations at both ends are frequent

## Stack

### Characteristics

-   Last In First Out (LIFO) structure.
-   Operations: push, pop, peek.

### Usage

-   Problems involving backtracking, function call management, and expression evaluation.

## Queues

### Characteristics

-   First In First Out (FIFO) structure.
-   Operations: enqueue, dequeue, front.

### Usage

-   Problems involving breadth-first search (BFS), task scheduling, and order processing.

## Hash Tables (Dictionaries in Python)

### Characteristics

-   Key-value pairs.
-   Average-case constant time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.

### Usage

-   Problems requiring fast lookups, frequency counting, and caching.

## Heaps/Priority Queues

### Characteristics

-   Binary heap is a common implementation.
-   Used to maintain a dynamic set of elements where you need efficient access to the smallest or largest element.

### Usage

-   Problems involving order statistics, scheduling, and merge operations.

## Trees

### Characteristics

-   Hierarchical structure with nodes and edges.
-   Common types: binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees.

### Usage

-   Problems involving hierarchical data, searching, and sorting

## Graphs

### Characteristics

-   Set of nodes connected by edges.
-   Types: directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted.

### Usage

-   Problems involving network connectivity, shortest path, and traversals (DFS, BFS).

## Tries (Prefix Trees)

### Characteristics

-   Tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings.
-   Commonly used for retrieval operations.

### Usage

-   Problems involving prefix matching, autocomplete systems, and dictionary implementations.
